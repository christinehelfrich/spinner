# Spinner Casino Game

# Overview


This project is a Spinner Casino Game, which allows the user to input a bet guess a number, and create a number of ticks on the spinner. My purpose of creating this software was that I wanted to create a fun game while simultaniously learning how to use the C++ language better. I think this particular program is especially useful because it is simple and very explicitly labeled and allows the user to control most of the flow of the game. I wanted to become better at programming with C++, which I think is a skill that will dramatically aid my efforts to become a better software engineer.

# Development Environment


A couple different tools were used in the creation of this program. Visual Studio Code was used as a development enviornment, C++ was used as the programming language, and the random number module was used to produce a random number for the spinner.
